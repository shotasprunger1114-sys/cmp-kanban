The framework. The system. Not the results yet — the methodology. Let them see how you think so they can imagine working with you.\n\nWeek 4: One Case Study. Doesn't have to be a massive client. Could be a friend's business you helped for free. Show the before. The decision. The after. Make it specific. Make it real.\n\nBy day 30?
